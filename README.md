# Mr. Robot Micropad

**Mr. Robot Micropad** is a quirky, minimalist two-key input device designed for Home Assistant users.

Built around a Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266) and a 0.96" OLED display, this little guy blinks, glances, and looks around the room with expressive animated eyes. Each key can trigger up to eight unique Home Assistant actions using single, double, triple tap, or long-press. Mount it anywhere with magnets, and customize it with your own keycaps, colors, and plate materials ‚Äî even the exposed wiring becomes part of the aesthetic.

## Assembly & Setup

1. **Print all components**
   Download STL files from Printables:
   üëâ [Mr. Robot Micropad on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1329568-mr-robot-micropad-a-two-button-smart-assistant-wit)

2. **Install magnets and heat-set inserts**
   Press-fit magnets into their designated slots. Install M1.6 heat-set inserts using a soldering iron.

3. **Mount the MX switches**
   Snap your mechanical switches into the printed switch plate.

4. **Wire the components**
   Use 28 AWG wire and follow the wiring diagram above to connect the switches and OLED display to the ESP8266.

5. **Assemble the enclosure**
   Mount the ESP8266 first, followed by the switch plate and OLED display. Use M1.6√ó4mm screws to secure components.

6. **Connect to your computer**
   Plug in the ESP8266 using the USB-C port.

7. **Flash the firmware**
   Use [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) to flash the firmware. A sample YAML config is included in this repo to get you started.
